# Kaiser3

A remake of the remake of the original C64/Amiga classic 1984 Kaiser game (developed by Markus Mergard, distributed by Ariolasoft) as well as the inofficial remake "Kaiser II" by Stefan Maday (1997-2004)

This is no commercial project but more a sign of respect for the original game which provided endless hours of fun when I was a kid. If you enjoyed the game as much as I did, feel free to help with that remake!
